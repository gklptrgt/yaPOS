- Fixed the numpad issue;
    When no number is pressed it will be gray, showing that it's currently masking.
    When a number is pressed it turns black showing that it's on edit mode.
    If 1 is pressed again it won't be 11 but will be black 1.

- No problem with the exchange rate calculations.

- Updated coloring of main categories to be able to identify by eye easier for which one is selected.
